            In a time long ago, in a small, peaceful town, there lived two lovers, Ryuo and Samantha. Their love was a bond that seemed unbreakable, filled with kindness and care for each other. Ryuo was a gentle and compassionate man, and Samantha was known for her warm heart and caring nature.

          <div class="second-p">
            One fateful day, Ryuo experienced something extraordinary. He had a vision, a glimpse into the future, a power that resided within his eyes. In this vision, he saw a catastrophic accident, one that would change the world forever. However, what struck him the most was that Samantha, his beloved, was a part of this terrible event.

          <div class="fourth-p">
            Samantha said she didn't want to worry about it because everything would be fine. because samantha also knew ryuo's power because she also had vision but it was different from ryuo's power because she could see someone's past by holding it in her hand. But she knew that it would happen no matter what Ryu did.
